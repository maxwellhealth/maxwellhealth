      <description>When I joined Maxwell Health in 2014, I was interviewed by our entire product team: a co-founder, our 2 engineers, and our designer. Even as our team grew to ~10 engineers, we all participated in every engineer interview. This was important to us because we had one scrum team, so weâ€™d all be working directly with a new colleague.
Eventually, our engineering team grew large enough that it became impossible to have everyone interview a candidate.</description>
