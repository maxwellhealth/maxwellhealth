      <description>Before I was hired by Maxwell Health back in May of 2018, I was in full job search mode but only for the second time as a developer. Many of my interviews with other companies focused solely on technical questions, or even worse, coding exercises on a whiteboard with little dialogue, which in my opinion is not the optimal way to measure a developer&amp;rsquo;s skill set.
When I interviewed at Maxwell Health, there were technical questions of course, but the coding portion focused on a peer programming exercise.</description>
