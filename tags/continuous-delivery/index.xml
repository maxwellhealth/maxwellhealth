      <description>When I read Jez Humbleâ€™s book Continuous Delivery a few years ago, I felt like I was being watched. I thought Jez had been monitoring us and watching us struggle with deployments. In 2015, Maxwell Health released once a week.

If things went wrong, we would try to fix forward.</description>
